# Spaceship

[Pygame][1] based visual toy for my nephew's rocket (little dude needs help with avionics!). Will
run on Raspberry PI with some I/O expanders to read pots and switches from the control panel. The
panel itself is from some advanced hobbyist flight simulator. I think it was meant to look like
Panavia Tornado [radar][2].
