# Spaceship

## What's that about?

[Pygame][1] based visual toy for my nephew's rocket (little dude needs help with avionics!). Will
run on Raspberry PI with some I/O expanders to read pots and switches from the control panel. The
panel itself is from some advanced hobbyist flight simulator. I think it was meant to look like
Panavia Tornado [radar][2].

## What's inside

1. Panel with pots, switches and push-buttons - random find on eBay, no manufacturer labels
   or anything.
2. [800x600 TFT LCD Display 8"][3] from Cool Components.
3. [ADC Pi Plus][4] from AB Electronics UK.
4. [IO Pi Plus][5] from AB Electronics UK.
5. Lots of hot glue behind the scenes.
